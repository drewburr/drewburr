### About me

Hello! Thanks for taking a look at my page!

Currently I work as an Application Platform Administator, managing middleware and application platform technologies. Basically, my job is to make it as easy as possible for a developer to deploy an application and consume parephreial services. I also spend a great deal of time figuring out how I can make my job as easy as possible. Using platforms such as Kubernetes, AWX, and ServiceNow, I've developed dozens of automations and processes that improve execution speed and consistency. These range from user access and password resets, all the way to VM provisioning and decommissioning; all at the push of a button.

My passion is to learn as much as I can and provide simple solutions that impress. I try to deep-dive into the technologies I get the privledge to work with, and use those technologies to help improve process and provide a better experience for both myself and my customers.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions about my work or if you're interested in my support!
