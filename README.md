### About me

Hello, welcome to my page!

My passion is to learn as much as I can and provide simple solutions that impress.

Some technologies I work with regularly:
- [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes)
- [Docker](https://github.com/docker)
- [Proxmox](https://github.com/proxmox)
- [Cloud Foundry](https://github.com/cloudfoundry)
- [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible)
- CI/CD processes ([Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins)/[CodeFresh](https://codefresh.io/)/[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)/[ArgoCD](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd))

Programming languages I'm experienced with:
- [Python](https://github.com/python)
- [NodeJS](https://github.com/nodejs/node)

I can also write [Java](https://github.com/openjdk/) and [Go](https://github.com/golang/go), with documentation in-hand.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions about my work or if you're interested in my support!
